  <span class="about-me">My name is
    <strong>Javier Romero</strong> and I love making websites. I studied Full Stack web development at Ironhack, where I learned
    how to build websites using Javascript, Html, Css, Sass, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express and Angular.
    <br>
    <br> I currently live in Barcelona where I've been working in Marketing and Advertising for a few years. Now I'm doing a
    carreer change and I'm looking forward to start my carreer as a web developer!
    <br>
